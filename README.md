# Roblox Guardian: Hide Exploiters & Malware üõ°Ô∏è

This **Tampermonkey** script hides repositories from the Roblox topics on GitHub that reference any kind of exploit or virus, as these are typically malicious. This script is designed to help users avoid harmful content like viruses or exploit tools.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Hides exploit-related repositories** üîí: Automatically filters out repositories with tags or keywords related to exploits, injectors, and cheats on Roblox.
- **Supports popular exploit keywords** üîë: Blocks repositories mentioning terms like "exploit", "injector", "cheat", and many more.
- **Automatic filtering** ‚öôÔ∏è: Runs in the background and continuously hides repositories as you browse.
- **Seamless GitHub integration** üñ±Ô∏è: Works directly on GitHub's topics pages for a cleaner, safer experience.

## Installation Instructions üì•

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the **Tampermonkey** extension installed in your browser. You can download it from the following links:

- [Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
- [Tampermonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)

### How to Install

1. Install the Tampermonkey extension in your browser.
2. Copy the script from the repository: 
   - [Roblox Guardian - Hide Exploiters & Malware](Roblox Guardian- Hide Exploiters & Malware.user.js)
3. In Tampermonkey, click **"Create a new script"**.
4. Paste the contents of the script into the editor.
5. Save the script and enable it.

That's it! The script will now automatically hide exploit-related repositories as you browse Roblox topics on GitHub.

## How it Works üõ†Ô∏è

- **Tag Filtering**: The script scans for specific tags in repositories (e.g., `exploit`, `roblox-scripts`, `roblox-injector`) and hides them if they match known exploit-related terms.
- **Keyword Filtering**: The script also checks the description of each repository for unwanted keywords like `executor`, `injector`, `cheat`, or `hack`.
- **Smooth UI Transitions**: When a repository is flagged, the script hides it with a smooth opacity and height transition, making your browsing experience seamless.
